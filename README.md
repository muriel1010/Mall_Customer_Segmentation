# Mall Customer Segmentation Project
This project aimed at performing customer segmentation on
a specific group of mall customers. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics
as it helps identify distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics and behavior. By segmenting customers,
businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and services to meet the unique needs and preferences of each segment, 
ultimately improving customer satisfaction and increasing revenue.
# Project Overview
In this project, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques, particularly the KMeans clustering algorithm,
to perform customer segmentation. KMeans is a popular
clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity, with the goal of minimizing the within-cluster variance.
The project involves the following steps:

# Data Collection:
Obtain the dataset containing information about mall customers, such as their age, annual income, and spending score.

# Data Preprocessing / EDA:
Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, scale features, and prepare the data for clustering.

# Univariate Clustering: 
Use KMeans to perform univariate clustering on individual features to identify clusters based on each feature independently.

# Bivariate Clustering: 
Perform bivariate clustering by considering pairs of features to identify clusters based on the combined behavior of two features.

# Multivariate Clustering:
Apply KMeans to identify multivariate clusters by considering all features simultaneously.

# Marketing Group Identification: 
Analyze the summary statistics to identify the best marketing group or segment that the business should target with
tailored marketing strategies.

# CONCLUSION 

- 60% of cluster 1 shoppers are woman, suggesting that we can work on marketing campaigns on products attracting these customers in the cluster.
- cluster 2 presents an interesting opportunity to market to the customers for sale events on popular items.
- Targeted groups having customers with high spending score and high income.
